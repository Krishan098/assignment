# Compound Protocol Wallet Scoring System

## Overview

This system provides a comprehensive machine learning-based approach to score Ethereum wallets based on their interactions with the Compound DeFi protocol (V2 and V3). The scoring methodology combines multiple behavioral, financial, and risk indicators to generate scores ranging from 1 to 1000, enabling the identification of sophisticated DeFi users, risk assessment, and wallet clustering for various analytical purposes.

## Data Collection Method

### Etherscan API Integration

**Why Etherscan API over Web Scraping:**
- **Completeness**: Captures all historical transactions (not limited by pagination)
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with structured JSON responses
- **Speed**: 10,000 transactions per API call vs 25-50 per web page
- **Data Quality**: Exact timestamps, gas prices, function signatures, error status

### Multi-Transaction Type Coverage

The system collects three types of transactions to ensure comprehensive analysis:

1. **Normal Transactions** (`txlist`)
   - Direct wallet-to-contract interactions
   - Primary method calls (mint, redeem, borrow, repay)
   - Function signature identification

2. **Internal Transactions** (`txlistinternal`)
   - Contract-to-contract calls triggered by user actions
   - Captures complex DeFi interactions and cascading effects
   - Essential for understanding compound transaction flows

3. **ERC20 Token Transfers** (`tokentx`)
   - cToken movements (cDAI, cUSDC, cETH, etc.)
   - Underlying token transfers
   - Cross-protocol token flows

### Compound Protocol Contract Coverage

**Compound V2 Contracts:**
- cToken contracts: cDAI, cUSDC, cETH, cWBTC, cUSDT, etc.
- Comptroller: `0x3d9819210a31b4961b30ef54be2aed79b9c9cd3b`

**Compound V3 Contracts:**
- cUSDCv3: `0xc3d688b66703497daa19211eedff47f25384cdc3`
- cETHv3: `0xa17581a9e3356d9a858b789d68b4d866e593ae94`
- V3 Comptrollers for different markets

### Function Signature Recognition

The system identifies specific Compound operations through function signatures:
- `0xa0712d68`: mint (supply assets)
- `0xdb006a75`: redeem (withdraw assets)
- `0xc5ebeaec`: borrow
- `0x0e752702`: repayBorrow
- `0xf5e3c462`: liquidateBorrow

## Feature Engineering & Selection

### Primary Features (Extracted from Raw Data)

1. **Transaction Metrics**
   - `total_transactions`: Count of Compound-related transactions
   - `total_value_eth`: Sum of ETH value across all transactions
   - `total_gas_fees_eth`: Total gas costs paid
   - `avg_transaction_value`: Mean transaction size
   - `avg_gas_fee`: Average gas cost per transaction

2. **Temporal Analysis**
   - `days_active`: Period between first and last transaction
   - `transaction_frequency`: Transactions per day
   - `avg_transaction_interval_hours`: Time between consecutive transactions

3. **Function Usage Patterns**
   - `unique_functions`: Count of different function types used
   - `function_diversity_ratio`: Diversity relative to total transactions
   - `mint_transactions`, `borrow_transactions`, `repay_transactions`: Operation-specific counts
   - `supply_to_borrow_ratio`: Lending vs borrowing behavior
   - `repay_to_borrow_ratio`: Debt management behavior

4. **Contract Interaction Patterns**
   - `unique_contracts`: Number of different Compound contracts used
   - `contract_diversity_ratio`: Contract diversity relative to activity
   - `compound_v2_usage` vs `compound_v3_usage`: Protocol version adoption

### Derived Features (Engineered for ML)

**Rationale**: Raw transaction data alone doesn't capture sophisticated user behavior. Derived features identify patterns that distinguish experienced DeFi users from casual participants.

1. **Activity Intensity**
   ```
   activity_intensity = total_transactions × transaction_frequency
   ```
   **Justification**: Combines volume and consistency to identify highly active users who maintain sustained engagement.

2. **Financial Sophistication Score**
   ```
   financial_sophistication = (unique_functions × 0.3) + 
                             (unique_contracts × 0.3) + 
                             (function_diversity_ratio × 0.4)
   ```
   **Justification**: Users who interact with multiple functions and contracts demonstrate deeper DeFi understanding and strategic behavior.

3. **Risk Profile**
   ```
   risk_profile = (failed_transaction_rate × 0.4) + 
                  (normalized_avg_gas_price × 0.3) + 
                  (liquidate_transactions × 0.3)
   ```
   **Justification**: Identifies users with higher risk tolerance or involvement in risky activities.

4. **Lending Behavior Score**
   ```
   lending_behavior = (supply_to_borrow_ratio × 0.4) + 
                      (repay_to_borrow_ratio × 0.4) + 
                      (supply_activity × 0.2)
   ```
   **Justification**: Distinguishes between borrowers, lenders, and balanced users.

5. **Protocol Adoption Score**
   ```
   protocol_adoption = (total_protocol_usage × 0.5) + 
                       (contract_diversity_ratio × 0.5)
   ```
   **Justification**: Early adopters and power users typically engage with multiple protocol versions and contracts.

6. **Volume Efficiency**
   ```
   volume_efficiency = total_value_eth / total_transactions
   ```
   **Justification**: High-value per transaction indicates institutional or sophisticated retail behavior.

7. **Gas Efficiency**
   ```
   gas_efficiency = total_value_eth / total_gas_fees_eth
   ```
   **Justification**: Efficient gas usage suggests experience and strategic transaction timing.

### Feature Selection Rationale

**Statistical Relevance**: Features were selected based on:
- **Variance Analysis**: Features with low variance (<0.01) were excluded
- **Correlation Analysis**: Highly correlated features (>0.95) were consolidated
- **Domain Expertise**: DeFi-specific indicators known to correlate with user sophistication

**Behavioral Significance**: Each feature captures a distinct aspect of DeFi behavior:
- **Activity Level**: Transaction count and frequency
- **Financial Scale**: Value and volume metrics
- **Sophistication**: Diversity and complexity metrics
- **Risk Appetite**: Error rates and liquidation involvement
- **Strategic Behavior**: Ratios and efficiency metrics

## Risk Indicators & Justification

### 1. Failed Transaction Rate
**Metric**: `failed_transaction_rate = failed_transactions / total_transactions`

**Risk Implication**: 
- **High Rate (>10%)**: Indicates inexperience, poor gas estimation, or risky behavior
- **Moderate Rate (3-10%)**: Normal for active users experimenting with DeFi
- **Low Rate (<3%)**: Suggests experience and careful transaction planning

**Justification**: Failed transactions cost gas without achieving objectives, indicating either technical inexperience or high-risk strategies that frequently fail.

### 2. Gas Price Patterns
**Metric**: `avg_gas_price_gwei` normalized by network conditions

**Risk Implication**:
- **Consistently High**: Either inexperienced (poor gas optimization) or urgent/MEV-related activity
- **Variable**: Adaptive behavior suggesting market awareness
- **Consistently Low**: Patience and gas optimization knowledge

**Justification**: Gas price behavior reveals risk tolerance, technical sophistication, and urgency of operations.

### 3. Liquidation Involvement
**Metric**: `liquidate_transactions` count and frequency

**Risk Implication**:
- **High Liquidation Activity**: Either liquidator (sophisticated) or frequently liquidated (risky)
- **Moderate Activity**: Occasional involvement in liquidation events
- **No Activity**: Conservative approach or limited exposure to risky positions

**Justification**: Liquidation involvement indicates exposure to leverage and position management quality.

### 4. Borrow-to-Repay Patterns
**Metric**: `repay_to_borrow_ratio`

**Risk Implication**:
- **Ratio > 1**: Responsible debt management
- **Ratio ≈ 1**: Balanced borrowing behavior
- **Ratio < 1**: Potential accumulation of debt or incomplete analysis period

**Justification**: Debt repayment patterns indicate financial responsibility and risk management capabilities.

### 5. Transaction Timing Patterns
**Metric**: `consistency_score` based on transaction intervals

**Risk Implication**:
- **High Consistency**: Systematic, potentially automated strategies
- **Erratic Patterns**: Emotional or reactive trading
- **Long Gaps**: Inactive periods indicating potential risk aversion

**Justification**: Timing consistency reveals strategic approach vs reactive behavior.

## Normalization & Preprocessing

### Outlier Detection & Treatment

**Method**: Interquartile Range (IQR) Capping
```
Q1 = 25th percentile
Q3 = 75th percentile  
IQR = Q3 - Q1
Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR
Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
```

**Rationale**: 
- **Preserves Data**: Caps outliers instead of removing wallets
- **Reduces Skew**: Prevents extreme values from dominating analysis
- **Domain Appropriate**: DeFi data has natural extreme values that shouldn't be discarded

### Feature Scaling

**Primary Method**: RobustScaler
```
scaled_value = (value - median) / IQR
```

**Alternative Considered**: StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler

**Justification for RobustScaler**:
- **Outlier Resilient**: Less sensitive to extreme values than StandardScaler
- **Preserves Distribution**: Maintains relative relationships better than MinMaxScaler
- **DeFi Appropriate**: Financial data often has heavy tails that RobustScaler handles well

### Missing Value Treatment

**Strategy**: Domain-Informed Imputation
- **Zero Imputation**: For count-based features (transactions, functions)
- **Median Imputation**: For continuous features with skewed distributions
- **Forward Fill**: For time-series derived features

**Justification**: Missing values in blockchain data typically indicate absence of activity rather than measurement error.

- Multiple random initializations (n_init=10)
- Standardized features input

**Justification**:
- **Peer Comparison**: Enables relative scoring within similar user groups
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies natural user segments in DeFi behavior
- **Score Calibration**: Cluster membership influences final scoring

### 3. Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection

**Purpose**: Identification of unusual wallet patterns

**Configuration**:
- Contamination rate: 10%
- 100 estimators for stability
- Anomaly score integration into final scoring

**Justification**:
- **High-Value Detection**: Anomalous behavior often indicates sophisticated users
- **Outlier Identification**: Separates truly exceptional users from data errors
- **Score Enhancement**: Positive anomalies receive score bonuses

## Scoring Logic & Methodology

### Composite Score Calculation

The final score combines multiple weighted components:

```
Composite Score = Σ(Feature_i × Weight_i × Normalization_Factor_i)
```

### Feature Weights & Rationale

1. **Total Value ETH (20%)**
   - **Rationale**: Volume is the strongest indicator of meaningful DeFi participation
   - **Impact**: Distinguishes institutional from retail users

2. **Transaction Count (15%)**
   - **Rationale**: Activity level indicates engagement and experience
   - **Impact**: Rewards consistent platform usage

3. **Financial Sophistication (15%)**
   - **Rationale**: Complex behavior patterns indicate advanced users
   - **Impact**: Favors users who utilize diverse DeFi strategies

4. **Lending Behavior (15%)**
   - **Rationale**: Core Compound functionality; good behavior should be rewarded
   - **Impact**: Distinguishes responsible vs risky behavior

5. **Protocol Adoption (10%)**
   - **Rationale**: Early adopters and multi-version users show commitment
   - **Impact**: Rewards platform loyalty and adaptability

6. **Transaction Frequency (10%)**
   - **Rationale**: Consistent activity indicates ongoing engagement
   - **Impact**: Favors regular users over one-time participants

7. **Efficiency Metrics (15% combined)**
   - **Volume Efficiency (7.5%)**: Value per transaction
   - **Gas Efficiency (7.5%)**: Cost optimization
   - **Rationale**: Efficiency indicates experience and strategic thinking

### Score Adjustments

1. **Cluster-Based Adjustment** (±10%)
   ```
   cluster_multiplier = (cluster_rank / max_rank × 0.2) + 0.9
   adjusted_score = base_score × cluster_multiplier
   ```
   **Rationale**: Peer group comparison ensures relative fairness

2. **Anomaly Bonus** (+10%)
   ```
   anomaly_bonus = is_anomaly × 0.1 × base_score
   ```
   **Rationale**: Positive anomalies often represent exceptional users

3. **Risk Penalty** (Variable)
   ```
   risk_penalty = risk_profile × (-0.05) × base_score
   ```
   **Rationale**: High-risk behavior reduces overall score

### Final Score Scaling

```
Final Score = ((Raw Score - Min Score) / (Max Score - Min Score)) × 999 + 1
```

**Range**: 1 to 1000
**Distribution**: Approximately normal with right tail for exceptional users
